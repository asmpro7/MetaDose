## CRAN Resubmission for MetaDose 1.0.1

This is a resubmission.

In response to the feedback from the incoming checks, I have made the following changes:

* **WARNING:** Runnable examples have been added to the documentation of exported functions so that the package code is exercised during automated checks.

No changes were made to the core functionality of the package.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
